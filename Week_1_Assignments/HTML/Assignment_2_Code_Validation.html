			Assignment 2: Code Validation (Explanation)
			- Code errors fixed.
			- <p> tag wasn't closed
			- Role attribute in the <button> tag had a 
			  typo (rol="button") and it is not a self-closing 
			  tag but it was self-closed instead of adding some 
			  button text and closed it with </button>
			- The last <p> tag was closed with a wrong </b> tag
