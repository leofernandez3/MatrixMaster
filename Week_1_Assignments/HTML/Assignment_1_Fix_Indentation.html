		Task 1 was to fix indentation (Explanation)
		- Code Indentation Completed.
		- I didn’t indent <head> and <body> because 
		  it’s a widely adopted industry convention. 
		  They’re typically treated as part of the 
		  document skeleton, and indenting them only 
		  shifts the document rightwards without 
		  adding meaningful structural clarity.
