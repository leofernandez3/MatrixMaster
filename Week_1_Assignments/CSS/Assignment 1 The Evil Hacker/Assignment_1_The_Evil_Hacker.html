            - Added display: flow-root to #container so that 
            it can wrap child elements with float properties

            - Added float:left to #nav_bar so that main content
            appears to the right of it

            - Added float:left to #main_content so that it appears 
            next to the #nav_bar container

            - Added float:left to .subcontent because these were stacked 
            vertically and this made them appear side by side

            -  Added float:left to #advertisements so that it no longer 
            goes behind the subcontent boxes

            - Adjusted the width of #advertisements to 640px so that it 
            aligns with the right edge of the last subcontent box 
            (previously it was 670px)
